# Images Folder

This folder contains photos for the Cold Form Steel Canada website.

## Important: Two-Branch System

Images are stored in the **`assets` branch** on GitHub, NOT in Figma Make.

## Upload Your Photos

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. **Switch to `assets` branch**
3. Navigate to this folder (`/public/images/`)
4. Upload:
   - `john-montgomery.jpg` - Photo of John (CEO)
   - Any other team photos or project images

## How It Works

Images in the `assets` branch are automatically pulled during Vercel builds.

See `/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions.
